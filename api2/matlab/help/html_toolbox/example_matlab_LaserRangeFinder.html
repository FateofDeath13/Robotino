         <p>Robotino can be equipped with a very precise Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 laser scanner. In this example we read the distance readings
            from the laser range finder. Based on the readings from the laser range finder, we can find out if Robotino is approaching
            an obstacle or not. In case it is, then we stop Robotino and let it rotate until it is clear of obstacles. If no obstacle
            is detected then we let Robotino move forward with a constant velocity.

%% Description
% Robotino can be equipped with a very precise Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 laser
% scanner. In this example we read the distance readings from the laser
% range finder. Based on the readings from the laser range finder, we can
% find out if Robotino is approaching an obstacle or not. In case it is,
